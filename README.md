## DIP-Project-Semantic-Aware-Colour-Transfer
~Implementation of the paper : Sky is Not the Limit: Semantic-Aware Sky Replacement

# Pipeline 

~Label Images with FCN model
~Retrieve images with diverse sky appearances and similar semantic content for replacement
~Replace the sky from the selected image to the target
~Transfer colour between target and source-sky images to match with the new sky
